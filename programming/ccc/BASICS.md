# Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) - Basics

## About CCC

The Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) is an annual programming competition for secondary school students with two levels:
- **Junior Level**: For students with basic programming skills (loops, conditionals, arrays)
- **Senior Level**: For students with advanced topics (graphs, dynamic programming, etc.)

## Problem Structure

### Input/Output
- All problems use standard input and output
- Read from `stdin` and write to `stdout`
- No file I/O is needed
- Be careful with input formatting and whitespace

### Time and Memory Limits
- Time limits: Typically 2-3 seconds per test case
- Memory limits: Usually 64MB-512MB
- Python solutions should be optimized for performance

### Problem Types
1. **Simple I/O**
   - Basic input processing and output formatting
   - Example: Simple calculations, string manipulation

2. **Data Structures**
   - Arrays, lists, dictionaries, sets
   - Stacks, queues, priority queues

3. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting and searching
   - Graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's)
   - Dynamic programming
   - Greedy algorithms

## DMOJ Platform

- **CCC Problems**: [CCC Problems on DMOJ](https://dmoj.ca/problems/?category=4)
- **Problem Tags**: Search by difficulty and topics

## Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read the problem statement carefully
   - Identify input/output format
   - Note constraints and edge cases

2. **Design the Solution**
   - Break down the problem into smaller parts
   - Choose appropriate data structures
   - Consider time and space complexity

3. **Implement**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Use meaningful variable names
   - Add comments for complex logic

4. **Test**
   - Test with sample inputs
   - Check edge cases
   - Verify against problem constraints

## Example Problem Template

```python
"""
CCC 'YY L# - Problem Name
Problem: [DMOJ Problem Link]

[Problem description]
[Input format]
[Output format]
[Constraints]
[Sample input/output]
"""

def main():
    # Read input
    n = int(input())
    
    # Process
    # ...
    
    # Output result
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
